## Code style rules:
    * Include docstrings for public functions
    * Prefer composition over inheritance
    * Keep functions under 100 lines before refactor, and below 50 lines after refactor.
    * Keep files under 3 functions
        - Prefer to aim for 1 function per file, and name the file the same as the function. 
        - You can store private functions, prepended with an underscore, in the same file.
